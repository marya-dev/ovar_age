## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive economic analysis of delaying menopause by 5 years. The analysis evaluates both health outcomes and associated economic impacts across multiple disease categories.

**Key Finding:** Delaying menopause by 5 years would generate a net economic benefit of **$60.9 million per 100,000 women** (equivalent to **$609.2 million per million women**) through reduced disease incidence and associated treatment costs.

---

## Methodology

### Data Sources
1. **Combined Menopause Data** - Risk ratios for early menopause across health outcomes
2. **Baseline Incidence Rates** - Disease incidence per 100,000 women in general population
3. **Disease Treatment Costs** - Annual treatment costs per disease (USD)

### Calculation Approach
1. **Baseline Rate**: Disease incidence in normal menopause population
2. **Risk Ratio**: Relative risk for early menopause vs. normal timing
3. **Early Menopause Rate**: Baseline rate × Risk ratio
4. **Cases Prevented**: Early rate - Baseline rate (cases avoided by delaying menopause)
5. **Present Value Factor**: PV = [1 - (1+r)^(-years)] / r
6. **Economic Value**: Cases prevented × Annual cost × PV factor

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Incomplete Risk Profile**: Current analysis does not include breast cancer or other potential negative outcomes of delayed menopause
2. **Time Horizon**: 6-year benefit window may be conservative or optimistic depending on intervention type
3. **Discount Rate**: 3% discount rate reflects standard health economic evaluations but may vary by context
4. **Treatment Costs**: Based on current healthcare costs; may vary by country and healthcare system
5. **Lifetime Costs**: Analysis uses annualized costs; lifetime disease burden may differ
6. **Quality of Life**: Economic analysis does not capture QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or patient well-being
7. **Prevention vs. Delay**: Analysis assumes disease prevention; actual benefit may be disease delay rather than prevention

## Recommendations

### For Research
1. **Add Breast Cancer Data**: Critical to complete risk-benefit analysis
2. **Expand Time Horizons**: Evaluate 10, 15, and 20-year benefit periods
3. **Include QALY Analysis**: Incorporate quality of life metrics
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test varying discount rates (0%, 5%, 7%)
5. **Stratify by Age Groups**: Different benefit profiles for various age cohorts

### For Policy Makers
1. **Cost-Effectiveness Threshold**: Compare net benefit to intervention costs
2. **Population Targeting**: Identify high-risk groups for maximum impact
3. **Healthcare Planning**: Allocate resources based on benefit distribution
4. **Long-term Budgeting**: Plan for reduced disease burden over time

### For Clinical Practice
1. **Risk Assessment**: Identify patients at highest risk from early menopause
2. **Treatment Selection**: Consider economic value alongside clinical outcomes
3. **Patient Education**: Communicate both benefits and risks of delaying menopause
4. **Monitoring Protocols**: Track long-term outcomes to validate projections

## Conclusions

Delaying menopause by 5 years shows substantial economic benefits, primarily through reduced cardiovascular disease and osteoporotic fractures. The analysis demonstrates potential savings of **$609 million per million women** over a 6-year period.

However, this analysis is **incomplete without breast cancer risk data**. The true net benefit could be significantly lower once all risk factors are included. Further research is needed to provide a complete risk-benefit profile before clinical or policy recommendations can be made.

The strongest benefits are observed for:
- Conditions with high treatment costs (osteoporotic fracture, dementia)
- Diseases with high early menopause risk ratios (stroke, CHD)
- Prevalent conditions (diabetes, fractures)

## Technical Notes

### Present Value Calculation
The present value factor accounts for the time value of healthcare savings:

```
PV = [1 - (1 + discount_rate)^(-years)] / discount_rate
PV = [1 - (1.03)^(-6)] / 0.03
PV = 5.417
```

This factor converts future annual savings into present value terms, accounting for the fact that savings realized in future years are worth less in today's dollars.

### Data Quality
- All source data verified from Excel datasets
- Disease name mappings implemented to handle nomenclature variations
- Calculations reviewed and validated against source methodology
